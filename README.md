### Hi there! 👋

I'm Kian. I'm a high-school student in California, USA. Some of my hobbies include
- 💻 programming
- 📻 amateur radio
- 🏕 backpacking
- 🏃 track & field

Looking around?
 - Check out my repositories to see some of my projects.
 - Projects which I've forked are under the [kdkasad-forks](https://github.com/kdkasad-forks) organization.
 - Small tools, scripts, and experimental projects that are low-quality are on my [personal Git server](https://git.kasad.com).
 - [My website](https://kasad.com) has some other small projects, too.
