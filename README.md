### Hi there! 👋

I'm Kian. I'm a high-school student in California, USA. Some of my hobbies include
- 💻 programming
- 📻 amateur radio
- 🏕 backpacking
- 🏃 track & field

I only use GitHub to collaborate on other projects which are hosted on GitHub.  
If you want to see my own projects, check out my [personal Git server](https://git.kasad.com).

I also have some other things on my [🔗 website](https://kasad.com).
